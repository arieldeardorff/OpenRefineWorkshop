Can we conclude anything about the times? 3.2 Undo/Redo When we make a mistake in OpenRefine, we use Undo/Redo rather than a back button. Let’s say we didn’t actually want to split Date Entered into DSLD into two columns. Click on Undo/Redo and select the action before the one we just did. Our split has now disappeared. 3.3 Faceting Data Faceting is one of the best parts of OpenRefine and can be used in a variety of ways including to get a snapshot of unique variables and to spot potential errors in your data. Let's facet to get a snapshot of our data: We can scroll down to see if our splits have worked correctly but it is always smart to double check with a facet. Let’s get a snapshot of our new Serving Unit column by selecting Facet &gt; Text facet On the left we can now see a list of all the different values in this column in alphabetical order or by count. There should be 433 choices. If we click on any of the options we will filter to just those rows. Some of the Serving Units look a little odd, but they were actually provided that way by the manufacturer so we will leave them for now. Challenge: What Brand makes a supplement that comes in the form of &quot;Gummy Dolphin(s)&quot;? Challenge: Use the Facet feature on the Serving Amount column. How many unique variables are there? What is the most frequent serving amount? Now let's use faceting to find some potential mistakes: Now let’s try faceting the LanguaL-Product Type column. It looks like we have 14 choices but some of these look a little odd. For example, it looks like we have 25 records for Amino acid/protein [A1305 and 2325 records for Amino acid/protein [A1305]. In this case we know that those 25 records should say [A1305].To fix this, we can click Edit next to those records, update the records, and select Apply. No we have 13 choices It looks like there are a couple more spelling mistakes in this column, we could fix them manually as we did above, but let’s hold off and use the clustering feature later. Challenge: Facet the Brands Names column, how many options are there? Do you see any potential mistakes? Challenge: Explore the other kinds of facets, do any of these seem useful to you? 3.4 Trimming Whitespace and Changing to Titlecase Some of the names in our Brand Name column look very similar. Before we spend a lot of time trying to manually clean or cluster all 1781 of them let’s try two easy cleaning steps. First, let’s trim any whitespace at the beginning or end of the row on the Brand Name column by selecting Edit cells &gt; Common transforms &gt; Trim leading and trailing whitespace – already our total number has come down to 1778 Next, let’s change everything to titlecase by selecting Edit cells &gt; Common transforms &gt; To titlecase – now we have 1693 options. 3.5 Clustering Data Now let’s clean up the rest of our Brand Name column using Clustering! Clustering is one of the most powerful features in OpenRefine! Clustering is a tool for grouping names that are similar so that we can bulk edit them – it works on the syntactic level (spelling) not semantic (meaning) In the Facet window for our column, let’s hit Cluster in the upper right-hand corner OpenRefine uses two main algorithms for clustering the data: key collision: generates a key from a value based on common transformations (what is the core value when you remove whitespace/capitalization/punctuation) nearest neighbor: each unique value is compared to every other unique value using a distance function Fortunately, we don’t really need to understand the algorithms because it is easy to try them all! In the clustering box we can see: Cluster Size: how many different options in that cluster Row Count: how many rows will be changed Values in Cluster: possible options Merge?: check box if you wish to merge those cells New cell value: what the cell should say Start with the Key Collision Method and work your way through the Keying function – there should be many options to cluster. If they all look good you can use Select all in the bottom left (note that you might need to decrease the size of your window to see this) If the selected replacement looks correct we can check the Merge box and then click Merge selected and re-cluster at the bottom As you work through the remaining algorithms you might see that some work better than others. Take a look at all the options but only cluster using the Key Collision – fingerprint, ngram fingerprint and Nearest Neighbor – levenshtein You should have approximately 1625 choices now (but don’t worry if you don’t have the same number) Challenge: Which methods and keying functions do not seem like they will work for the Brand Name column? Challenge: Facet and Cluster the LanguaL-Product Type column. How many unique variables do you end up with? 3.6 Sorting Right now the data is sorted by Brand Name first, what if we wanted to sort by DSLD ID? Under DSLD ID select Sort and we want to sort by numbers. Note that we can position errors and blanks at the beginning to help us spot them if we want. Hit Ok when you are happy with your sort. You can edit your sort by selecting Sort again under the specific column. You can also select Sort &gt; Reverse or Remove sort to undo (since it is not listed in the Undo/redo column). Note that this didn't add any steps to the Undo/Redo - the sort is not permanent If we wanted it to be permanent we would select Sort in the top middle &gt; Reorder rows permanently We can sort by multiple things, just sort each row in the order you want them sorted (view the order in the sort menu) ex: sort DSLD ID then Brand Name "]]
