This is a notes document to help instructors use this tutorial in an online workshop setting.

# Welcome

- After I introduce myself have the class introduce themselves out loud or via the zoom chat (if there are more than 10 people).
    + Should share their name, department, what kind of data they work with, and what tools they currently use to clean their data.
- Spend some time going over the zoom setup:
    + might want to split their screen if on one monitor
    + get help via the chat, can also unmute and ask me to repeat something (encouraged to help others in the chat!)
    + will use the non-verbal feedback. Practice giving the green yes/red no
    + share the link to the online tutorial to follow along - don't need to worry about taking notes

# Getting to Know our Data and Tools 

- Do yes/no checks after opening the tool and loading the data to make sure everyone is on the same page

# Basic Data Cleaning with OpenRefine

- Report the answer to the challenges in the zoom chat.
- For Faceting Data - consider using breakout rooms for the challenges - poll learners to see what they want to do
- 5 min break at the end of this section

# Advanced OpenRefine

- Consider breakout rooms for the last challenge

# Exporting Cleaned Data and Scripts

- Discussion Q: Does anyone have a good file naming scheme they want to share?

# Recommended Resources and Tutorials

- Wrap up question for the chat: How do you think you will use this tool in your work?
- Time for questions at the end (via chat or out loud)
